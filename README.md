# 📧 Spam Email Detector

A simple and effective machine learning web app that classifies emails as **spam** or **ham (not spam)** using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The app is built with **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Gradio** for a clean, interactive interface.

This project demonstrates the use of text preprocessing, feature extraction via **TF-IDF**, and a **Multinomial Naive Bayes** classifier to detect spam messages. It’s an ideal beginner-friendly project for exploring real-world applications of machine learning in email filtering.
